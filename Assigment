Design Classes and Create Objects
 
For this lab you will create a new program that creates a class named Student that contains the following data about a student:
1.	Name
2.	Student ID number
3.	GPA
4.	Expected grade in this course
5.	Full time or part time.

Create five student objects from this class and pass data to fill in the class data above.  Besides creating the object, you will write a menu-driven program that performs the following tasks:
1.	Look up and print the student GPA
2.	Add a new student to the class
3.	Change the GPA of a student
4.	Change the expected grade of a student
5.	Print the data of all the students in a tabular format
6.	Quit the program 
Save all the files that you created in this program with appropriate file names.
